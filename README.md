# fitnessSite
This is a fitness website. It has seven modules: calculator, cards, form, modal, slider, tabs, timer and service file. This site has a webpackage module. 
And if you want to download and launch my site, you most download to project node.js, becouse this site uses a json-server. In future ะต each module will be separately painted.
